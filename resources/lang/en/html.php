<strong>Projects</strong> which launch <strong>Expeditions</strong>. Maybe you\'d like to manage a project by yourself. 
In that case, your group will have one member. But maybe you want to share responsibility. In that case you will invite 
collaborators to the group.  You can have as many groups as are necessary to manage your project portfolio.</p>
<p>If you have not yet read the BIOSPEX help content, including the <a href="/ourvision">Our Vision</a>, 
<a href="/faq">FAQ</a>, and (soon to come) Resource pages, we encourage you to do so now. It will help you to use the 
system efficiently.</p>
<p>Still have questions? Feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns using the <a href="/contact">Contact</a> page.</p>
<p>Ready to start? Go ahead, create your first Group.</p>'
