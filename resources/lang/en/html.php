                    <p>The world\'s 3 billion biodiversity research specimens provide the historical baseline for
                        understanding the patterns of Life\'s diversity and distribution today and projecting future
                        changes to it. But information about the majority of these specimens languishes in cabinets.
                        BIOSPEX is a basecamp for launching, advertising, and managing targeted efforts to digitize
                        these
                        specimens. We recognize that motivations to digitize the data can vary a lot, from the museum
                        curator to the descendants of a collector reconstructing their ancestor\'s steps to an
                        environmental
                        group interested in the health of a local water body. BIOSPEX enables each of these to package
                        their projects in one or a series of digitization expeditions, launch the expeditions at
                        crowdsourcing
                        tools, and widely recruit others to participate. In the end, you can download the new data AND
                        the
                        data goes back to the museum that curates the physical specimen.</p>
