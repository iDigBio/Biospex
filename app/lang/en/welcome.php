					<p>Follow these instructions to create your first project.</p>
					<p>A <b>project</b> contains the most complete set of data that will be sent out for transcription
					and/or georeferencing as smaller <b>expeditions</b>. A project may contain tens of thousands of
					records. We recommend dividing it into several smaller expeditions of hundreds or just a few
					thousand that are more manageable for the digitization tools and more exciting for citizen
					scientists. You may choose to separate the expeditions based on year, taxa, location or another
					variable. You may also separate at random.</p>
					<p>The first step in creating a project is to click <b>Create</b>, and provide the descriptive
					information that is requested on the page that follows. The material you provide on this page will
					be used when your data are sent out for transcription (Notes from Nature) and/or georeferencing
					(GEOLocate) and will be seen by citizen scientists who will use this information to decide if
					they are interested in and qualified to participate.</p>
					<p>You are now ready to upload data to BIOSPEX. Click <b>Data</b> and follow the instructions to begin this
					process. After you upload your first expedition, you can use the
					<b>Clone</b> feature to upload additional expeditions with the same
					descriptive information. The <b>Edit </b>and <b>Delete</b> features
					are also available once you upload an expedition.</p>
					<p>When you have uploaded your dataset,
					you can then <b>Process</b> your project to send it off for
					transcription or georeferencing. Follow the progress made by citizen
					scientists from your Project page.
					<p>Still have questions? Feel free to
					contact us with any questions or concerns.</p>',
