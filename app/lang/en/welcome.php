	                <p>BioSpex works by using groups, projects and expeditions. Here is an introduction.</p>',
	'groups'    => '<h4>Groups</h4>
	                <p>Groups let you work with other people. If you joined BioSpex by invitation, then you 
	                are part of someone else\'s group. Otherwise, we made you a group of your very own. You can invite colleagues to your own group.</p>',            
	'projects'    => '<h4>Projects</h4>
	                <p>Projects are sets of your data that you want processed. The project also contains the 
	                descriptions of your targets for processing. The description you provide will be used when 
	                your data are sent out for transcription (Notes from Nature) and/or georeferencing
					(GEOLocate) and will be seen by citizen scientists who will use this information to decide if
					they are interested in and qualified to participate.</p>',
	'expeditions'    => '<h4>Expeditions</h4>
	                <p>Expeditions are sub sets of your data that get sent to various digitization tools. While a 
	                project may contain tens of thouands of records, expeditions may contain only a few hundred. 
	                You may choose to separate the expeditions based on year, taxa, location or another variable. 
	                You may also separate at random. We recommend dividing your data into several expeditions that 
	                are more manageable for the digitization tools and more exciting for citizen scientists.</p>',
