 * with sortable capabilities, allowing actors to be ordered within workflows.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Supports caching for improved performance
 * - Implements sortable functionality for ordering actors in workflows
 * - Uses AsPivot trait for enhanced pivot model capabilities
 * - Provides custom sort query building for workflow-specific ordering
