/**
 * Trait HasGroup
 *
 * Provides group management functionality for Eloquent models. This trait
 * enables models to have relationships with groups and provides methods
 * for assigning, detaching, and checking group membership. It's commonly
 * used with User models to implement role-based access control.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Group assignment and detachment functionality
 * - Group membership checking with flexible input types
 * - Admin group verification based on configuration
 * - Support for both string and object group identification
 *
 * Requirements:
 * The model using this trait must have a 'groups' relationship defined
 * (typically a many-to-many relationship with the Group model).
